In Malcom Gladwell's book Outliers, he makes the interesting claim that hockey athletes born earlier in the year have a serious advantage over those who had birthdates from July on. The claim is that this benefit translates into an over representation of certain age groups in elite hockey programs.

Some of the text from the book is listed below: 

â€œIt's a beautiful example of a self-fulfilling prophecy. In Canada, the eligibility cutoff for age-class hockey programs is Jan. 1. Canada also takes hockey really seriously, so coaches start streaming the best hockey players into elite programs, where they practice more and play more games and get better coaching, as early as 8 or 9. But who tends to be the "best" player at age 8 or 9? The oldest, of course -- the kids born nearest the cut-off date, who can be as much as almost a year older than kids born at the other end of the cut-off date. When you are 8 years old, 10 or 11 extra months of maturity means a lot."

The claim is interesting, makes sense, and seems plausible - but is it true? There seems to be some contention - several articles online that state that Malcom Gladwell got it wrong.

In this repo we will be scraping data from the web in an attempt to see if his claim is true or just a myth. If true, does the same logic extend to other sports?
